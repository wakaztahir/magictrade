        <h1>What currencies do you accept?</h1>
        <p>
            Deposits can be made in Monero or Bitcoin.<br />
            Withdrawals are Monero only.
        </p>
        <h1>What fees do you charge?</h1>
        <p>
            We have no fees except a 4% withdrawal fee.<br />
            The party, usually the seller (except for disputes), who receives the funds pays the withdrawal fee.
        </p>
        <h1>My deposit hasn't shown up?</h1>
        <p>
            Make sure you sent the exact amount displayed on the payment page.<br />
            If your deposit hasn't been credited after 15 confirmations (10 for Bitcoin deposits), contact us.
        </p>
        <h1>How long do I have to open a dispute?</h1>
        <p>
            Buyers have until the finalization time is over to dispute.
            If the buyer doesn't dispute before the finalization timer is over, the funds are transferred to the seller.
